# EMT-DDD-Project-Bank


A small exercise to try and implement Domain Driven Design in a project for the course Electronic and mobile commerce at Faculty of computer science and engineering, Skopje.  
The project consists of three microservices that communicate using Apache Kafka.  
The frontend of the project is developed using ReactJS, and the backend is developed using Spring Boot.  
This is an individual project and the entire code was written by me.
